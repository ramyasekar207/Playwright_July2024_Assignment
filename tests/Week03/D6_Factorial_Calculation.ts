/**
 * 
1. Write a function named `factorial` that accepts an argument `n`, which is a non-negative integer, 
and returns its factorial. 
2. Include a check to ensure that the factorial is not computed for negative numbers. If a negative 
number is passed, the function should throw an error. 
3. Use a loop to compute the factorial. Initialize a result variable and multiply it by each integer 
from 2 up to `n`. 
4. Include example calls to the `factorial` function with different integers to demonstrate the 
functionâ€™s functionality. Include at least one example where an error is thrown due to a negative 
input.
